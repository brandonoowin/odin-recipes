        <p><em>Furikake Rice</em> first made its debut in episode 2 of Food Wars. Although it is only made of rice, scrambled eggs, chicken, and green onions, this simple dish relies on a secret ingredient to make it special: gelatin cubes. </p>
        <p><em>This recipe is a tad difficult if you have little cooking experience, but it gets easier after you've prepared the chicken broth.</em></p>
