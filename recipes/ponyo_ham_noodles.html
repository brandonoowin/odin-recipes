        <p><em>Ponyo's Ham Noodles</em> doesn't have an official name, but it goes by a few monikers - such as ham noodles, Ponyo noodles, and Ponyo ramen. 
            Here's how you can level up your instant noodles with just 2 ingredients:</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>x1 packet of instant noodles</li>
                <li>x1 slice of cooked ham</li>
                <li>x1 egg</li>
                <li>x1 green onion</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil water</li>
                <li>Transfer the boiling water into a saucepan. Add the egg and add more boiling water until the egg is fully submerged.</li>
                <li>Cover the saucepan with a lid and wait for about 8 minutes. Proceed to Step 5 in the meantime.</li>
                <li>After 8 minutes, retrieve the hard-boiled egg, cut it into half, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Chop green onion into bits.</li>
                <li>Slice the ham into halves. Put both ingredients aside.</li>
                <li>Add instant noodles in a bowl. Pour boiling water over the noodles and cover with a lid. Set aside for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>After the first minute, separate the noodles and add in ham, hard-boiled egg and green onion. Cover the ramen bowl with a lid again. </li>
                <li>Wait for 2 more minutes and the dish is ready.</li>
