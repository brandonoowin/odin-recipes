        <h1>Spirited Away - RedBean Bun </h1>
        <img src="../images/spirited_away_redbean_bun.jpg">
        <p><em>Spirited Away's RedBean Bun </em> was sighted in the best-animated film of all time - Spirited Away. Chihiro, the protagonist, munched on a 
            mega-sized red bean steamed bun as she gazed into the night. 
            While its much easier to buy it from a supermarket, making this pastry from scratch can be pretty fun and satisfying.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>x1 cup of red beans</li>
                <li>x5 cups of water</li>
                <li>x1 3/4 cup of sugar/li>
                <li>x1 1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>x4 cups of flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of instant yeast</li>
            </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the red beans thoroughly before transferring into a cooker.</li>
                <li>Add in 3 cups of water and cook for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Add sugar and vanilla extract into the rice cooker. Keep stirring until the water is fully absorbed by the red beans. This might take up to 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Set aside and wait for it to cool down.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, 2 cups of lukewarm water, and yeast in an electric mixer until it forms a smooth dough.</li>
                <li>Knead for 10 minutes. 
                    Place the dough into a bowl and cover with cling wrap. Wait for an hour until the dough has risen to twice of its original size.</li>
                <li>Add the cooled red bean compote into a blender. Blend until smooth.
                    Add more flour on the surface of the dough and knead the dough into balls bigger than your palms.</li>
                <li>Flatten each ball and place some red bean paste into the middle of the dough. Slowly stretch and seal the dough around the red bean paste. </li>
                <li>Leave the dough under a wet towel for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add parchment paper into a steamer and place the buns inside. Steam for about 12 minutes.
                    Turn off the heat for 1-2 minutes and the steamed buns are ready.</li>
            </ol>
